# Icelabâ€™s dry-web skeleton

This is an opinionated starter skeleton for [dry-web][dry-web] projects at [Icelab](http://icelab.com.au/), but you might find it useful too!

It uses:

* [dry-web][dry-web] for the core application container and dependency management
* [Roda][roda] for HTTP handling and routing
* [ROM][rom] for database persistence
* [dry-view][dry-view] for data-oriented view rendering
* [dry-validation][dry-validation] for data validation (e.g. HTML forms)
* [dry-types][dry-types] for shared application type coercions and constraints
* [dry-transaction][dry-transaction] for modelling complex business transactions
* [i18n][i18n] for i18n-ing of things
* [Que][que] for background job processing

It also integrates with these 3rd party services:

* [Bugsnag][bugsnag] for error reporting
* [Postmark][postmark] for email deliveries
